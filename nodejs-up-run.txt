Intro

Write a tiny web server with Node.JS and "server-side" javascript.

Up & Running

1. Install Node.js; from nodejs.org; download it.
   [node-v10.15.1-x64.msi]

2. Open a CLI and create (mkdir) your tiny app folder and switch (cd) to it:

    mkdir myapp
    cd myapp

3. Setup your app project to use Node via Node's package manager (npm).
   (Note, you are still in your "myapp" folder.)  This command will
   prompt you for stuff.  Just type the ENTER key except for the choice
   "entry point: (index.js)", which instead of just ENTER, you will
   change to (say) "app.js" -- and remember this "entry point" for use below.

    npm init
 
   See a new "package.json" file appear in your "myapp" folder.

4. Install Express.js, a small "web app framework", via npm.  (Still in
   your "myapp" folder.)

    npm install express --save

  Npm "knows" where Express.js is on the web.  You'll get a
  "node_modules" folder in "myapp".  The "--save" command line option
  updates your "package.json" file with a dependency link to "express.js".

5. Create a file named "app.js" (your "entry point", as entered above)
   containing the following:

    // File: app.js
    var express = require('express'); // Load the Express builder fcn.
    var app = express();  // Init an Express object.
    app.get('/', function (req, res) { // Set page-gen fcn for URL root request.
        res.send('Hello World!'); // Send webpage containing "Hello World!".
    });
    app.listen(3000, function () { // Set callback action fcn on network port.
        console.log('app.js listening on port 3000!');
    });

6. Run the app "website" on your machine. In "myapp", type the command:

    node app.js

   See "App.js listening on port 3000!" in your CLI.

7. In your browser, go to the website at: http://localhost:3000/
   You should see your "Hello World!" webpage.
   Now, change your webpage html to do what you want, and reload the
   page.
   Escape your CLI via the std keystroke (eg, control-C. maybe).
