Merge Out
- Arguments Needed:
	1. the repo 
	2. a repo source snapshot = R snapshot (manifest file and files uploaded)
	3. a target project tree folder
First step for Merge-out should be to automatically check in target folder. 
	- That target snapshot is called the "repoT" snapshot with special file name.
Next step would then add new files/folders from R snap (the repo) to that target tree folder with special file name.
